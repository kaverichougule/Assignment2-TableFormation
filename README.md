# Table Formation
The table tag is used to create the table.
tr represents a table row, and <th> represents table header cells for column headings.

The first row has three header cells that define the column headings: "IMAGE," "VISIT LINK," and "DESCRIPTION." <br>
The second row has a single header cell that spans across all three columns, indicating the category "CARS." <br>
The third row contains the data for the "CARS" category: <br>
The first cell contains an image of a car with a link to a larger version of the image. <br>
The second cell contains a paragraph of description text. <br>
The third cell contains a link to view more details about the car. <br>
Similar structures are repeated for the "WATCHES" and "SHOES" categories in the subsequent rows. <br>

border="2", cellpadding="4", and cellspacing="5" to add styling and formatting to the table, such as setting the border style, cell padding, and spacing between cells.
